Strategies
=============

Intro: GET XP!
--------------
To be the very best, like no one ever was, you’re going to have to collect
a lot of Pokemon, and strong ones at that.  Since the Pokemon you have 
are capped in power relative to what level you are, you’re going to 
want to level up as much as possible.  The ways you get XP are doing gym battles,
catching Pokemon, visiting Pokestops, hatching eggs.
You get bonus XP for catching new Pokemon or catching Pokemon in certain ways.
For all of these things, you get twice as much XP
when under the effects of a Lucky Egg.

.. _strategies-pokestops-ref:

You Need Resources: Pokestops
-----------------------------
Since you need to catch Pokemon for XP, you’ll need Pokeballs.
You’ll also need Potions and presumably Revives to battle Gyms as well.
For both of these things, you’ll need to visit Pokestops.
Since you’ll need to collect a lot of these resources, you’ll want to
find a path you can take to visit these Pokestops over and over again 
in a short amount of time (the Pokestops are available again after 5 minutes).
Along the way there will be a lot of Pokemon for you to catch,
and you’ll hatch the eggs in your incubators if you walk far enough.
For a Simpson College campus example, you can walk through Buxton Park,
visiting each of the 4 Pokestops in there, and then go down around Wallace,
College Hall, and Mary Berry to get the 3 Pokestops in that area, 
and then continue on back to Buxton Park.  By the time you get back,
the Pokestops will have reset and you can go back through for more.

.. _strategies-coins-ref:

You Need Coins: Gyms
--------------------
You need coins to get items, each of which helps you in a different way.
For more information, see the items page: :ref:`intro-to-items-ref`

You’ll want to do this as much as possible until you have enough Potions
to take the gyms in the area and the timer for collecting coins from gyms
resets for you.  Then you’ll want to use the best Pokemon you have to face off
against the Pokemon in those gyms.  You’ll want to power up any Pokemon
that you can; this is what the Stardust you get for catching and hatching
Pokemon is for.  You’ll also want to make sure yours have a type advantage 
against theirs so that yours do more damage to the opposing Pokemon 
while taking less damage themselves.  
The chart below shows what the type advantages and disadvantages are.

As a general tip, you’ll want to keep a diversity in your group
of strongest Pokemon.  If all of your best Pokemon are water type,
you’ll have a tough time fighting a gym full of grass and electric types.
Doing so will involve catching and evolving a diversity of Pokemon,
which will get you the XP bonus for getting new Pokemon, 
so it will help you level up as well.

.. _strategies-xp-ref:

You Need XP: Incubators and Lucky Eggs
--------------------------------------
Once you have as many gyms as you think you can get before 
they start getting taken over by another team, 
open the shop and claim your coins and stardust.  Mostly use these 
to buy incubators; hatching eggs grants a large chunk of XP (200 XP for 2Ks,
500 XP for 5Ks, 1000 XP for 10Ks).  
Every once in a while, you will want to buy a Lucky Egg and 
start evolving the Pokemon you have. 
Since the Lucky Egg lasts 30 minutes,
you’ll want to have 30 minutes worth of evolutions lined up before 
you activate the Lucky Egg to get your coin’s worth from it.  
Each evolution will take about 24 seconds to complete and get to the next one,
so you should be able to get 75 evolutions done in that time.  
Wait until you have that many evolutions lined up before using the Lucky Egg.
That way you can maximize the amount of XP you get from it (about 75000 XP).

.. _strategies-powerful-pokemon-ref:

You Need Powerful Pokemon
-------------------------
You may notice that the Pokemon have differing CP numbers; while a higher CP
does indicate that it is more powerful than it would be with a lower number,
you also need several other pieces of information when evaluating your Pokemon.
You can have your team leader appraise your Pokemon and tell you its potential.
When you have your Pokemon appraised, they will tell you how it is overall,
they will tell you what stat it is best in (HP, Attack, or Defense), and they
will tell you how they are in their best stat.  The Pokemon you really want to
focus on are the ones that have the highest rating both overall and in their 
best stat (for example, a Mystic player would be looking for a Pokemon that's a
wonder with stats that exceed calculations).  
The three team leaders say different things for each rating; below
is a series of tables with their phrases and what they mean.
Something to keep in mind is that with these high rating Pokemon, the appraiser
saying that their different stats are equally matched by another means that it
is more powerful than one that only has one best stat. A Pokemon that has
their Attack equally matched by their Defense has more potential power than one
that just has Attack as their best stat, and one that is equally matched in
Attack, Defense, and HP is better than either.  If that one is also a wonder
with stats that exceed calculations, it is the best it can possibly be: evolve
that one and power it up to max, you're not going to get any better.
