Intro to Items
--------------
Pokemon Go has quite a few items to gather.  
Many of them are used in the Pokemon catching experience, 
and others are used in the process of battling.  
You either get them from Pokestops, from levelling up, 
or from buying them with in-game currency.

Pokestop Items
--------------
Many of these items can be gathered from Pokestops, 
with each stop giving a random assortment of items 
appropriate to your level when you visit them 
(clicking on them and swiping the image so that the ring spins).
Pokeballs of various kinds can be gathered from Pokestops,
depending on your level.  
**Pokeballs** are always available there,
**Great Balls** are available from level 12 onward,
and **Ultra Balls** are available from level 20 onward.  
As you may have guessed, each of these is better than the last; 
an Ultra Ball catches Pokemon more readily than a Great Ball, 
which catches Pokemon more readily than a standard Pokeball.  

Pokestops also give out various Potions.  
There are **Potions**, **Super Potions**, **Hyper Potions**, and **Max Potions**.  
Potions are unlocked at level 5 and heal the Pokemon you use them on by 20 HP.  
Super Potions are unlocked at level 10 and heal your Pokemon by 50 HP.  
Hyper Potions are unlocked at level 15 and heal your Pokemon by 200 HP.  
Max Potions are unlocked at level 25 and heal your Pokemon entirely.  
Revives are another kind of item that Pokestops give; 
they are available from level 5 onward.  
Max Revives are unlocked at level 30 and revive your Pokemon 
while healing them to 100% HP.  Razz Berries are unlocked at level 8 
and make it so that the Pokemon you give them to are easier to catch.

Shop Items
----------
You can also get items from the Shop.  
You can buy coins there for real money, 
or claim coins for taking gyms (once per 21 hours).  
You can use those coins to buy various in-game items, 
including incubators, lure modules, lucky eggs, and incense.  
These items are available normally in the game as well; 
certain numbers of these are given to you when you level up.  
You can also buy upgrades to your bag (so you can hold more items) 
or your Pokemon storage.
Incense attracts wild Pokemon to your location, 
so you can catch more Pokemon without going out and about quite as much.  
Lure modules do the same, but for Pokestops,
and other people benefit from its effects as well.  
Lucky Eggs double the amount of XP you get for in-game actions.  
Each of these items last for 30 minutes.  
The incubators you buy will last for 3 incubations before disappearing, 
unlike the default one you start with that lasts for an infinite number of incubations.
