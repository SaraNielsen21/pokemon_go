which all have green spots on them.

In order to start the hatching process, you have to place the egg in an incubator, one egg per incubator. 
Every playes starts off with an incubator that can be used an unlimited amount of times. 
If you wish to have more incubators to try and hatch multiple eggs at the same time, 
you would either have to level up enough to recieve incubators as rewards or you would have to go to the in-game store and buy more. 
Each of these additonal incubators will work for only three uses, then will become unusable. Once in the incubator, 
you must walk the specified amount of kilometers in order for the egg to hatch.
