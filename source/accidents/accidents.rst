Accidents While Playing Pokemon Go
==================================

Missing Persons Reports
-----------------------

Very strangely, people all over the globe are going missing while playing this highly-addictive game.
For instance, about a quarter of the country has gone missing since the release of Pokemon Go.
Most of the reports are from the nothern and southern borders, most likely because people are going over 
the borders and not realizing where they are until their phones die and they have
no means of calling their people to find them.

Other reports are even staranger than others, with actual pokemon said to be spotted 
around the people who have gone missing. One report stated that a player was seen with a Snorlax, 
and, an hour later, the Snorlax was seen in the same place, 
but the player was nowhere to be seen. It seemed as though the Snorlax had just eaten.

Hospitals Getting Full
----------------------

People are reportedly running into walls, stepping on alligators in swamps, 
standing still in the middle of traffic, etc., etc., etc. 
As a results, the hospitals are becoming more and more lively with injured players.
In some states, churches are now being used to house the injured people, 
with the inuries ranging from meer broken ankles to full-body paralysis.

Accidental Deaths
-----------------

There has even been reports of countless deaths from playing this game, from car crashes to missteps from tall buildings. One report even stated that a deceased man spent his last moments underwater to successfully capture a Mew. There were witnesses to this tragic accident at the scene, but they, too, were too busy trying to capture the Mew as well and did not even notice the man had drowned until all of their phones died.
