Achievements
============

What Are They?
--------------

While playing the game, you can unlock certain bonuses through achievements. These achievement badges have three different colors: blank if you haven't achieved bronze yet, bronze, silver, and gold. Broze gives you a +1 catching bonus for the type of pokemon the badge pertains to, silver gives you a +2 catching bonus, 
and gold gives you a +3 catching bonus.
The catching bonuses make catching these types of pokemon slightly easier.

Some achievements, however, don't include any kind of catching bonuses at all. These achievements are purely for fun, with some of them taking into account the amount of kilometers you've walked or how many Pikachu you have caught.
