Evolutions
============

What Are They?
--------------

Basically, evolutions are then next form of a pokemon. A pokemon can have up to two evolutions (which means that the pokemon has three forms), or the pokemon could have no other form at all. In later generations, there are more than three forms that a pokemon can have, but, as for right now, Eevee is the only one with \ **more than**\  three forms, so we won't go into too much detail about that.
